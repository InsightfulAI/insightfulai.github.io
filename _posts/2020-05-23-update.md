title: Update Information - New UI, Stylisation Amount Adjustment and More
---
The next update for Infusion will come with several new features, such as a new UI, a slider to adjust the "amount" or "strength" of the styling to be applied, and an ability to search through art styles in the style bank. This update is estimated to be released in mid June.

## New UI
We've finished designing Infusion's UI and will be implementing it in the app in the coming weeks. The new UI will be more intuitive and more professional and will replace the current placeholder UI. Below are some of the concept images from the new design.

## "Style strength" slider
The style strength slider is a highly-requested feature and will allow you to adjust how much the stylisation is applied. It will take place as a single slider but may be updated in the future. The below image demonstrates the effect of adjusting this slider to different values.

## Seaching through the style bank
A search bar will be added to the style bank for easier navigation.
