title: What's new in v0.7 Alpha
---
Infusion v0.7 comes with several new features, including a completely overhauled UI and new options to adjust.

## New UI
We've completely overhauled Infusion's UI. The new UI is designed to be simpler to use and more aesthetically pleasing. The new UI is also consistent across platforms (Note: small differences might be present) so you can have a unified experience no matter which platform you're using Infusion on.

## "Style amount" slider
We added a slider that will allow you to adjust how much stylization to apply when using Infusion. A higher style amount will produce a more abstract and stylized output whereas a lower style amount will produce an output image that more closely resembles the original.
