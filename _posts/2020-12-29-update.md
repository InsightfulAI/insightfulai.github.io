title: Update Coming Soon - Preset Styles, Reduced Watermark Size, Infusion Pro, Open Beta
---
Infusion v0.8 will have several new features, such as preset styles, reduced watermark size, an optional Pro subscription and the launch of a public beta. This update will be coming soon to Android and iOS devices.

## Preset styles
We added a number of preset styles to help you get started when making an artwork. These preset styles include "Scenic Mode", "Portrait Mode" and more. These preset styles automatically adjust Infusion's various sliders so you can get artworks more quickly.

## Reduced watermark size
We reduced the size of the watermarks applied to images generated by Infusion. We are still considering how watermarks will work in Infusion for free users. If you have any opinions on the matter, [please let us know](/infusion/feedback.html)

## Infusion Pro
We added an option to purchase a Pro subscription to unlock more features. For Pro users, we added more fine-tuning options that allows you to control the stylisation strength for different levels of detail. Pro users can also turn off watermarking.
