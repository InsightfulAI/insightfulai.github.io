## Preset styles
In v0.8, we added some preset styles to help you get started. These presets are ideal for when you want a quick result without fiddling with the neural network parameters too much. There are presets for different types of photos, such as scenery and portraits.

## Infusion Pro
For power users, we added an optional Pro subscription. Right now, we've added more fine-tuning options that allow you to fine-tune the neural network stylisation. We plan on adding more features for both Pro and free users in the future.

## Removed watermarks
Free users will no longer have their photos watermarked with an Infusion logo. However, if you would like to show other people that you're rich, you can purchase a pro subscription and get an exclusive Infusion Pro watermark on your photos.
