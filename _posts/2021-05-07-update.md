title: What's new in v0.9 Beta
---

Infusion 0.9 is Infusion's biggest update yet, and with it we are proud to announce that the pre-orders for Infusion are now open! Generate images up to 4K and use the new preserve colours feature to create amazing artworks.

## Pre-orders launch
The Infusion pre-order is now ready! Pre-order it by following the instructions on the [Download](/infusion/download.html) page. Infusion will be automatically downloaded onto your devices when it launches.

## Higher resolutions up to 4K
We did some clever technological magic to help you get much higher resolutions on your devices using Infusion's exclusive LightBooster technology. Now you should be able to generate artworks up to 4K in resolution with the help of Infusion's LightBooster. We've also done some optimisation so that you should be able to generate artworks up to 1440p without LightBooster if you have a capable device. Please note that maximum image resolutions may vary depending on the device.

## Preserve Colours
Preserve Colours is another feature available to all Infusion users for free. With certain styles, it can create incredibly realistic watercolour effects, adding a new dimension to your AI artwork arsenal.
