With Infusion 1.0, we are proud to annouce the official worldwide launch of Infusion on the App Store and Google Play. Infusion 1.0 will launch on July 1 2021. Here are some of the new features coming in Infusion 1.0.

## Infusion manual
With Infusion v1.0, there is now an official Infusion manual where all of Infusion's various functions are explained. You can check out the Infusion manual [here](/infusion/manual/).

## Various optimisations
We've optimised parts of the user interface in order to prepare for the launch.

Thank you for your support of Infusion during the alpha and beta testing. It's been a great pleasure to develop the app alongside you all. Keep on creating!
