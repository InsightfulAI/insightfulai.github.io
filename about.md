# The Team
## Founder: Wenzheng "William" Du
William founded Insightful AI in 2019. He had taught himself programming at the age of 13 and spent the next few years making games under the name [Increditastic Games](http://increditasticgames.blogspot.com/). He is a prominent app developer, having made several successful games with tens of thousands of downloads such as [Ninja Duel](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.increditastic.fightyninjas) and [Ninja Masters](https://increditastic.wixsite.com/ninjamasters). Eventually, after feeling that game development wasn't rewarding enough, he decided to learn machine learning. This resulted in the app that started Insightful AI - the InClassifier.
