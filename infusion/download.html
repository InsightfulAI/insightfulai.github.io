        <p>
            Infusion is currently in alpha development. You can join the testing program by following the instructions below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow the iOS link and you will be prompted to download an alpha version of Infusion. As it is still in active development, it may be unstable and 
            features may be continuously added or modified, and the current version is in no way representative of the final version. iOS Alpha testing is limited 
            to 100 users.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you use Android, then you will need to follow the Android link and join the Google Group. Further instructions will be available to you once
            you have joined the Google Group.
