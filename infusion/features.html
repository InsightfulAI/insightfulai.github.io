        <h1>Fine-Tune Your Creations.</h1>
        <p>
            Infusion allows you to make fine changes so you can make the best possible AI artworks. For example, you can fine-tune
            how much stylisation is applied to the image so the final result will be more suited for your purposes.

        <h1>Prototype Rapidly.</h1>
        <p>
            With our exclusive Quick Preview render option, you can prototype your AI artworks much more quickly. 
            The quick preview feature allows you to get a look into what the finished artwork will look like much more quickly, 
            at the cost of only slightly reduced quality. This way, when you render the final artwork, you know it will look the best.

        <h1>Infinite Styles.</h1>
        <p>
            Infusion is not just limited to a handful of filters. In fact, it can paint artworks in any style as long as you provide the relevant
            style reference image. It can be van Gogh or Picasso, or a picture of a flame or a galaxy. Select any style that you see fit instead of
            having your creativity constrained by a handful of presets. There is also a Style Bank of preselected artworks to help you get started.

            We are always adding new features to Infusion. These features may be available in the future: 4K artwork generation, batch image generation,
            adding your own images to the Style Bank, preserving colors and more. Stay updated via official Infusion news. We listen to your feedback.
