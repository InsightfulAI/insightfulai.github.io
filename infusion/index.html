            <h1>What is Infusion?</h1>
            <h2>What’s the difference between Infusion and a photo filter?</h2>
            <p>
                Infusion is an upcoming app on Android and iOS that turns your photos into art. However filters can also change how your photos look. 
                So what’s the difference?
            </p>
            <p>
                The difference is simple. Infusion is not a filters app because it’s an intelligent artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because it’s intelligent, Infusion is <b>easy</b> to use. Infusion makes <b>exciting</b> artworks. 
                And Infusion is <b>personalised</b> for you. Fundamentally, Infusion understands art, and that’s what makes it different to photo filters
            </p>
            <p>
                Don’t think of Infusion as a simple app. Think of Infusion as an artist that lives on your phone.

            <h1>Easy.</h1>
            <h2>Intelligent art creation is as simple as 1+1.</h2>
            <p>
                Infusion is easy to use. Filters have esoteric names like “chrome” or “sepia”, but Infusion is simple to use. 
                Pick a photo, choose a painting, and Infusion will do the rest. 
                Being an intelligent AI, Infusion doesn’t need you to fiddle with a thousand sliders to get the results.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simply give it a photo and show it a painting, and Infusion will paint the photo in the painting's style. It's as easy as 1+1.

                <p>
                    Infusion makes exciting art. Filters don’t do anything special. They don’t fundamentally change an image. 
                    They only shift some colours around. Infusion fundamentally changes the whole image into a painting. 
                    Because Infusion is intelligent, it understands art. 
                    This means it can paint your photos in the vivid brushstrokes of Van Gogh or in Picasso’s signature cubist style.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Infusion's artworks are exciting enough to make anything stand out. Make your blogs pop out. Add a splash of colour
                    to your graphic design. Surprise your followers on social media. Infusion makes art and photography more exciting
                    than ever.

            <p>
                Infusion is personalized just for you. Filters are made by someone else who doesn't understand you. 
                However, Infusion knows that you understand yourself the best. 
                You can load any artwork into Infusion, your favourite painting, your favourite style, even something your favourite person painted. 
                You can present yourself in any way, because Infusion can understand an essentially infinite number of styles. 
                Every artwork you make with Infusion is unique to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                See yourself in a different light. Find something that's uniquely yours. Stand out from the crowd. 
                It's not hard when your photo can look like every painting ever made. Your imagination really is the limit.

            <h1>Intelligent.</h1>
            <h2>The most advanced AI to ever run on a phone.</h2>
            <p>
                Infusion is powered by a neural network - a form of artificial intelligence (AI) modelled after the human brain. 
                This artificial intelligence is what gives Infusion its intelligence: its ability to recognise brush strokes and colours. 
                It allows Infusion to perform a state-of-the-art technique called neural style transfer which creates beautiful artworks from pictures.
            </p>
            <p>
                Confused by the technobabble? All you need to know is that Infusion is more advanced by anything that had come before. 
                So advanced, that we had to write custom code to get it on your phone.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a simplified visualisation of the neural network.
