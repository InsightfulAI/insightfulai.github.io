            <h1>Unparalleled Quality.</h1>
            <p>
                Artworks created Infusion are detailed, realistic and truthful to the original image. 
                Powered by a neural network with 34, 276, 299 parameters, Infusion understands how artistic style is different from the contents of an image, 
                allowing it to produce stunning artworks without modifying the contents of the original image.

            <h1>Power and Performance.</h1>
            <p>
                High quality. High performance. These are what separates Infusion from the competition. 
                Infusion is powered by a state-of-the-art in neural style transfer that can generate 
                higher-quality artworks than any other technique on the market. It is also blazing fast. 
                We estimate the 1080p image on the left would only take 90 seconds to generate on an iPad Pro (3th/4th Gen), 
                up to 26x faster than previous algorithms on comparable hardware.

                <p>
                    Infusion's artworks don't have to work on their own. Since Infusion can mimic any artistic style, 
                    you can use famous artworks to express your message effecively. 
                    Find out how we integrated an Infusion artwork of the Sydney Opera House into Vincent van Gogh's famous Starry Night 
                    by clicking on the "Tutorials" button below.

            <p>
                Generate unlimited artworks. Use unlimited styles.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anytime you feel like, you can load a reference style into Infusion and generate an artwork. 
                You can take a photo of a painting and use that as the style, 
                and you can do that again for as many times as you would like with no time limits or token systems. 
                Your creative freedom is important to us.
