                <p>
                    At Insightful AI, we are innovators and rulebreakers who want to change how artificial intelligence is used to empower people. Compared to 
                    large corporations using AI, we want to create private and practical tools that give users control over the technologies used. Our aim is
                    to challenge industrial norms regarding of quality and data collection practices of AI applications, by creating an AI art app that outputs
                    better results than our competitors while being completely offline.
