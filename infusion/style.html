        <h1>Not just any style. Your style.</h1>
        <h2>Never worry about not standing out.</h2>
        <p>
            Photos are so yesterday. They're so dull and uninspired. They have no personality. But an artwork says something about a person, an artwork
            has personality, and an artwork has style.
        </p>
        <p>
            With an intelligent artist at your fingertips, never worry of being dull or uninspired again. Turn your photos into artworks in the style of
            your favourite painting. It can be something that you found in a museum, it can be a painting your grandmother made. Express yourself in any style;
            it will be uniquely yours.
        </p>

        <h1>More than a thousand words.</h1>
        <h2>Say what words can't express.</h2>
        <p>
            There are moments that words can't express. Moments that photos don't do justice to. But a painting is unique. An artwork says more about the subject
            than meets the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Infusion, you can preserve all your precious memories into paintings. You can even hang them up on a wall.

            The whole point of Infusion is that it's an intelligent artist. As an intelligent artist, it is able to understand the features of any artwork
            and replicate them onto your photos. It works with any style: cubism, pencil sketches, impressionism and post-impressionism etc. You can even try
            some more interesting styles such as a mosaic or a picture of a fire.
        </p>

            Given that there are 1,592,524,800 possible images with the dimensions 1920x1080 (1920x1080x256x3), it could be said that there are approximately
            1.59 billion possible styles that Infusion can use. However, that is not counting the various ways you can configure Infusion to produce different results,
            which results in an essentially infinite number of styles as you can simply run the output through Infusion again. On the other hand, it could also be argued
            that there are less than 1.59 billion styles as some of those pictures only differ by one pixel. There are certainly many different ways of counting, but
            the number of distinctive styles is so large that it may not be worth counting at all.
