            Infusion is based on the VGG19 convolutional neural network developed by a research team at Oxford. Its architecture mirrors that of a human
            brain and it was trained with huge image datasets. From those datasets, it extrapolated common image features which allows it to create artworks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Infusion is based on the latest research in neural style transfer. The techniques used allows for the generation of high-quality artworks at an
            unprecedented speed. We worked hard to put this cutting-edge work into an app that you can use.

        <p>
            Your images will never be uploaded to any server. Infusion does all of its work offline. That's right: if you download Infusion, then there
            really will be an intelligent artist that lives on your phone! Don't trust us? Turn off your internet and Infusion will still work.
        </p>

            Privacy is a really big concern in this day and age. We respect your privacy.

        <h1>So good, you can see the brushstrokes.</h1>
        <h2>Artist, not filter.</h2>
        <p>
            See for yourself below. Infusion is not a filters app. It is an intelligent artist. It actually learns the brushstrokes and colours used by the
            original artist.
