        <p>
            Infusion is something you have to see to believe. It will contain one of the most advanced machine learning models available on smartphones and 
            tablets. When we were developing it, it surprised us sometimes. There were photos that we thought wouldn't
            work, and Infusion proved us wrong every single time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you've been reading about Infusion for so long, why not try it out for yourself? It's free. Why not have an artist follow you wherever you go?
        </p>
        <p>
            Follow the iOS link and you will be prompted to download an alpha version of Infusion. As it is still in active development, it may be unstable and 
            features may be continuously added or modified, and the current version is in no way representative of the final version. iOS Alpha testing is limited 
            to 100 users.
        </p>

            If you use Android, then you will need to follow the Android link and join the Google Group. Further instructions will be available to you once
            you have joined the Google Group.
