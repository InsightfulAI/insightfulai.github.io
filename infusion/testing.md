# SEEING IS BELIEVING
## Join Infusion's alpha testing program.

Follow this link and you will be prompted to download an alpha version of Infusion. As it is still in active development, it may be unstable and features may be continuously added or modified, and the current version is in no way representative of the final version. Alpha testing is limited to 100 users.

If you're a journalist, a separate link exists for you. It is recommended that you contact us through the link provided in the [Press](/infusion/press.html) tab.

You will be prompted to download an app called "TestFlight" by Apple which you will use to download Infusion. More information on TestFlight can be found [here](https://testflight.apple.com/).
