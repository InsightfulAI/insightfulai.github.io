InClassifier is an iOS app utilising the device's camera to recognise objects, meaning people with visual impairments can use InClassifier to quickly scan an unfamiliar environment. InClassifier is based on the [Xception model](https://keras.io/applications/#xception) which can recognise 1000 unique objects with a top-5 accuracy of 94.5%.

## Neuroball - Man vs Machine

![Neuroball](/assets/images/neuroball.png)

Neuroball is a simple [Swift Playground](https://www.apple.com/au/swift/playgrounds/) which demonstrates some of the capabilities of artificial neural networks. In Neuroball, you play a game inspired by table tennis against a bot. However, as you play, your movements are recorded. You can choose to train a basic neural network which mimics your movements. If you play aggressively, then the network will play aggressively. If you play passively, then the network will play passively as well.

Neuroball demonstrates that artificial neural networks have applications in many fields, some surprising, like gaming. As Neuroball is just a proof of concept, it may be prone to technical issues. It is available on GitHub under the Apache Licence 2.0.
